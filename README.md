Understanding Topic Modeling
Topic Modeling automatically discover the hidden themes from given documents. It is an unsupervised text analytics algorithm that is used for finding the group of words from the given document. These group of words represents a topic. There is a possibility that, a single document can associate with multiple themes.

Comparison Between Text Classification and Topic Modeling
Text classification is a supervised machine learning problem, where a text document or article classified into a pre-defined set of classes. Topic modeling is the process of discovering groups of co-occurring words in text documents. These group co-occurring related words makes "topics". It is a form of unsupervised learning, so the set of possible topics are unknown. Topic modeling can be used to solve the text classification problem. Topic modeling will identify the topics presents in a document, while text classification classifies the text into a single class.

Use Cases of Topic Modeling
Simple applications in which this technique is used are documented clustering in text analysis, recommender systems, and information retrieval. More detailed use-cases of topic modeling are:

Resume Summarization: It can help recruiters to evaluate resumes by a quick glance. They can reduce effort in filtering pile of resume.


Search Engine Optimization: Online articles, blogs, and documents can be tagged easily by identifying the topics and associated keywords, which can improve optimize search results.


Recommender System Optimization: Recommender systems act as an information filter and advisor according to the user profile and previous history. It can help us to discover unvisited relevant content based on past visits.


Improving Customer Support: Discovering relevant topics and associated keywords in customer complaints and feedback for examples product and service specifications, department, and branch details. Such information help company to directly route the complaint to respective department
